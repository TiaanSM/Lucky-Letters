Game Planning and Design:

// How the game works: Game Mode 1

The player gets a set of identical boxes.
The player has the option to add a box to their section.
Each box generates a random letter.
If their letter(s) match the box below then the player wins points.
The player can choose the amount of letters they want.
If they generate a valid English word then the player wins extra points.
The leaderboard ranking is based on the length of the letter matched and the amount of clicks to get a match.
If the player has an record holding word then they will be added to the leaderboard.
The player gets points for a match 1 point per letter.
No matches results in no points.
There will be a section with a countdown to give the player a point every min.
